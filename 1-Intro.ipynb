    "This language allows the definition of **Agents** (the entities that compound and interact in the system) and **Rules** (the *events* that may happen with known probabilities in the system). These are the main elements of a Kappa model that allow to simulate its behaviour in time."

See **-LINK-** for a detailed description about interfaces.\n",

Both rules include a name label, a *Left Hand Side* of reaction (**LHS**, the reactants), a *Right Hand Side* (**RHS**, the products) and a **rate**.\n",

This solution is a statistically correct *time-trajectory* of the system, obtained by applying every event explicitly. Therefore, most of the systems will need several simulations and some statistical analysis. The KaXim parameter **--runs N** allows to produce **N** *time-trajectories* at once, using **OpenMP** libraries to take advantage from parallel architecture. The Kappa variable [ID] can be used in Kappa models to obtain the simulation *Id*, from 0 to **N**. \n",
